# ENS-pythonGraph
Quick project for the french school : Ecole normale sup√©rieure

## The project
This python script was designed to work on multiple concepts at once, such as : 
- dijkstra algorithm
- Object oriented programation
- API call
- html rendering

## My work 
### location
Everything is in the ```main.py``` file

### implementation
I was explicitly asked to make it simple. So I focused on avoiding complex implementation, like functionnal programming or other implicite structure. 
It resulted in a looog code (hundred + lines only for dijkstra method), but I also made sure that everything was well-compartimented. 

The code is obviously basic, but It was a fun approach to get my hands back on graph and python.
